Hello GenioPay,

This project is a great one.

Some tweaks i made on the project :

i wasn't able to get some of the icons from the figma file, so i used some
similar icons

also, i wasn't really clear about the part where you said 
"For every device this screen is viewed on, all navigation options and properties should be seen on one screen"

i am not really clear about it, but either way, i made the layout the same on 
all devices and used the 1440 x 1024 dimensions as a starting point.

then for devices that have a very small height, i made the sidebar able to scroll.
why did i do that ?

now dashboards look a lot different on tablet and mobile devices, as they have to fit the screen's width so that they can be easily accessible to the users, so in the case of mobile and tablets, we hide the sidebar and leave a button that would slide in the sidebar on click.

i made the screen size the same for all devices because you asked me to do so.
but it is not a nice way to do it for mobile and tablet device according to responsive web design. 
so i believe it's because this is a test.

my dashboard looks great but if what i did was not what you meant by "to look the same on all screens" then you can let me know, and i will easily make some adjustments.

there is no layout i cannot build.

thank you very much for this opportunity.
